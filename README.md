# WeTransfer Product Engineering Career Framework

As an engineer, you may at times have wondered what's next. You may even have asked your manager. Will I stay in my current role indefinitely? And if not, what does the organisation expect from me in order to take the next step? We've created this framework for you.

Not even that long ago, the entire WeTransfer engineering team could fit in one phone booth. You would work on whatever was needed that particular day, and impact was in linear relationship with the company's success. We are now well over 60 engineers. Impact, while still reflected in our collective success, is much more a function of personal growth. We work in teams on what we think the world needs tomorrow. This requires planning, not only of what to work on but also of where to grow to.

Our Product Engineering Career Framework describes roles of increasing seniority on two career tracks (Individual Contributor and Manager). The purpose of the framework is to guide engineers in their professional development, align expectations around performance and promotions, and limit the potential room for bias in how we recognise success. 

We are making our career framework public to help anyone looking to build their own, or for those who are just curious about how we think about career progression at WeTransfer.

You can find our the career framwork itself here, on our internal Notion wiki:
